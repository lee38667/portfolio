# Netlify Forms Configuration
# No environment variables needed - Netlify Forms are automatically configured
# when you deploy to Netlify with the data-netlify="true" attribute

# Note: Forms will only work when deployed to Netlify
# For local development, forms will not submit but won't cause errors
